# ðŸŒŸ Mini CV â€“ HTML & CSS

This is a simple one-page static website that displays my mini CV. After learning CSS, I styled the HTML to give the page a bit of personality while keeping the layout clean and minimal.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features
- Basic HTML structure for personal info, education, and experience
- Custom CSS styling to enhance visual appeal
